Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched 75% of the lecture videos so far.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I’ve scheduled to watch the videos on weekday evenings from 7 PM to 9 PM at home, in a quiet study space.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m staying on top of the programming assignments and reviewing the lecture notes regularly, which helps reinforce my 
understanding of the key concepts.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on watching the lecture videos, especially when I fall behind. I should also plan for 
more consistent revision sessions.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I’ve been rushing through the practicals without fully understanding some of the concepts. I’ll focus on asking more 
questions and revisiting areas where I struggled during the practicals.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I’m good at solving the smaller programming problems, breaking down tasks into smaller steps, and debugging my code 
efficiently during the practical sessions.
